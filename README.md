# COLLEGE FOOTBALL
## Description:

### About the project:
College Football website was designed in order to make the gaming experience of football games more fun, interactive and enjoyable. Players can usually get a bit bored by repeatitive nature of the game, so to make things more exciting three features were added. 
- The first one was the **Match-Up** feature. Here the user can choose from _David v/s Goliath_, _Heavyweights_ and _Derby_ modes. According to the choice of the user, two random teams will be assigned to two players. This makes the team selection unpredictable and allows the user to try out more teams and different gameplay modes.
- The second feature was **Top-Stars**. Here, the user can get the perfect player according to his needs. The user will provide his player's playing position, his age range and additionally the special qualities which he wants in his player. This can give rise to multiple different combinations of positions, ages and qualities, and the top players that fit into the specified category will be displayed.
- The third and last feature is **Know Your Team**. Users who are new to football or who do not have enough knowledge about the teams will find this feature useful. The user has to select a team from the given pool of teams and a brief description about the selected team will be displayed, describing their history, greatest achievements, the playstyle of the team and also some of the team's best players.

This project was created as my final project for the CS50x course by Harvard.
